@article{Edelman:1977wy,
	abstract = {A review is presented of the studies on the basis of which the contemporary model of the carrier spectrum in bismuth has been established. Descriptions are presented of the theoretical models and of experiments that make it possible to elucidate their connection with the real spectrum and with the parameters of the models. These experiments include investigations of the conduction electrons on the Fermi level and measurement of the characteristics of the Fermi surface, magneto-optical investigations of the closelylocated valence and conduction bands, and investigations in a quantizing magnetic field. Problems that require further refinement are considered, and experiments that can contribute to progress in this field are proposed.},

@article{Hasegawa:2006tu,
	abstract = {Carrier densities and mobilities in polycrystalline bismuth contaminated with 0.01at{\%} tin are determined by measurement of various electronic transport parameters in low magnetic fields from 50 to 300K. The parameters measured include the Seebeck coefficient, resistivity, magneto-resistance and Hall coefficient. The present sample exhibits the temperature-dependent variations in electron carrier density seen for single-crystal bismuth. However, due to tin contamination of 0.01at{\%}, the hole carrier density is invariant below 150K. The mobilities are somewhat lower due to boundary scattering, with the reduction in electron mobility being prominent. The proposed method allows the temperature dependences to be determined reliably even in the presence of contamination, and represents a useful technique for the analysis of carrier densities and mobilities in high-mobility materials under low magnetic fields.},

@article{Michenaud:1972wx,
	abstract = {Measurements of the low field galvanomagnetic tensor components of bismuth from 77 to 300K are reported. The eight magnetoresistivity coefficients Aij are found to vary as T-2 up to nearly 120 K, then as T-3.9 from 120 to 300 K. The electronic parameters are computed. The values of the electron ellipsoid tilt angle lie between 6 degrees 40' and 8 degrees 30' and the carrier density varies from 4.55*1017 to 24.5*1017 cm-3 at 77 K and 300 K respectively. All mobilities except mu 2 vary as T-2 in the lowest temperature range.},
