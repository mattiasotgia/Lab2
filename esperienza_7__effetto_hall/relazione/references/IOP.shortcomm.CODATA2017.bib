	abstract = {Sufficient progress towards redefining the International System of Units (SI) in terms of exact values of fundamental constants has been achieved. Exact values of the Planck constant h, elementary charge e, Boltzmann constant k, and Avogadro constant NA from the CODATA 2017 Special Adjustment of the Fundamental Constants are presented here. These values are recommended to the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures to form the foundation of the revised SI.}
