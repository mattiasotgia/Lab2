# Lab2 Group (2021-22) :rocket:

This repo is made to hold all the code and data generated by lab experiments.

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mattiasotgia/Lab2)](https://github.com/mattiasotgia/Lab2/releases/latest)

There are two branches: `main` and `active`.

***Latex files*** Current status of latex files.

## Usage

This repo should be maintained up-to-date with the latest experiments and data.

There is a `./esperienza_#__<title>` folder for each one lab. experience. Those are then divided as described in README for each sub-directory. 

The `setup.py` file is meant to be used to create the base project for a lab. experience. To run [setup.py](setup.py) use `python3 setup.py <OPTIONAL: expNumber_title>`

## Requirements

Software needed to use this repo is listed below:

- [`root`](https://github.com/root-project/root), An open-source data analysis framework used by high energy physics and others, developed by CERN (currently using [`v6.24/02`](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-24-02) or [`v6.22/06`](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-22-06) to run code);
- `stat` custom library (Currently `v1.0`). Run as `g++ -o <exe_name> <program.cpp> stat.cpp`.
- `LabTools.h` is a C++ library only used for general purpouse C++ classes and namespaces for easier graph manipulation and statistical computation (see [LabTools installation and usage](#labtools-installation-and-usage)).
- [ErrorAnalysis/ErrorAnalysis.h](https://github.com/mattiasotgia/ErrorAnalysis) class function used to compute error propagationa and analysis.
- various python libraries are used: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `pandas`, mainly for data analisys on-the-go, alongside with `jupiter-notebook`.
- [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) is a software used for schematics simulation, needed to read `.asc` files.
- [`PyLTSpice v1.5`](https://pypi.org/project/PyLTSpice/)(also on [Github](https://github.com/nunobrum/PyLTSpice)) and [`ltspice 1.0.4`](https://pypi.org/project/ltspice/) are used for LTSpice simulation automation in Python and for data visualization.
<!-- - `numpy` Python library is only needed in order for the [setup.py](setup.py) program to work.  -->

Future code might need other libraries, that will be eventually be written here.

## Stat Library

`stat` is a `C++` library made exclusively to compute the statistical average and standard error. It is located in [`stat/stat.h`](stat/stat.h).

***Library Usage***

This library is just a piece of code written to facilitate some computing, eventually it needs to be implemented in the code.

* `stat::read_values()` takes a `stdin::vector` as input, whereas the vector contain all data needed in calculation.

* `stat::avg()` return average of elements in the `vector`.

* `stat::std_err()` return standard error computed from RMS (Root Minimum Square).

* `stat::clear()` is needed to clean up the data vector, in order to compute other data. 

## LabTools installation and usage

Inside [LabTools](LabTools/) there is the full definition and implementation for the LabTools c++ library. It needs to be compiled and if used in ROOT needs to be included in the `rootlogon.C` root file. 

### How to install

inside `LabTools` folder go to `build/` (`cd build`).
Then do the following
```bash
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
Then go to $HOME and create (if non existing!) the `.rootrc` file by doing
```bash
$ touch .rootrc
```
and add the following line to `.rootrc`:
```
Rint.Logon: ~/rootlogon.C
```

Finally, in your $HOME directory create a file named `rootlogon.C` by doing
```bash
$ touch rootlogon.C
```
and modify this file adding the following lines
```cpp
{
    gInterpreter->AddIncludePath("/usr/local/include");
    gSystem->Load("/usr/local/lib/libLabTools");
}
```

Now to load the Library in any program you'll need to
```cpp
#include<LabTools.h>
```

If using ROOT macros, no other compiler instruction is needed.
To use this library in compiled c/c++ programs you'll need to do the following: 
```bash
$ g++ file_name.cpp -o exe_name -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib/ -lLabTools `root-config --glibs --cflags`
```
where `` `root-config --glibs --cflags` `` is only needed if the code calls for other ROOT specific functions.

### Usage
#### Namespace `base`
Some standard methods.

`bool base::isIn(_container _C, const _Ty &_Val)` check if given value/string (`class _Ty` object) is inside a container (`class _container`:`enum` or `union` type). 

#### Namespace `log`
Logging passed to stdout. This is not a logger!

`void log::print_mmsg(std::string mmsg)`: print `mmsg` to stdout.

`void log::print_stat(TF1 *_f)`: print <!-- $\chi^2/\text{ndf}$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cchi%5E2%2F%5Ctext%7Bndf%7D"> and <!-- $\text{prob}(\chi^2)$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctext%7Bprob%7D(%5Cchi%5E2)"> to stdout. 

#### Namespace `stattools`
Some useful and recurring statistical-computation functions.

`double stattools::max_to_stat(double value)`: divide any given number to the squate root of 3.

`std::string stattools::compatible(double G1, double errG1, double G2, double errG2)`: check 3 sigma compatibility between G1 and G2, given their error.

`double stattools::getbestvalue(double G1, double G2, double errG1, double errG2)`: compute error-weighted mean value.

`double stattools::getbestvalueerr(double errG1, double errG2)`: compute error-weighted mean error.

#### Namespace `graphset`

`void graphset::set_TGraphAxis(_TObj *g, std::string ytitle, float offset = 2, std::string xtitle = "")`: Automatically sets-up the `_TObj` graph axis, and combined with the following methods, is pretty useful for creating residuals for current graph.

`void graphset::set_ResidualsAxis(_TObj *rg, std::string xtitle, float offset = 2, std::string ytitle = "Residui [#sigma]")`: sets-up residual graph axis.

`struct graphset::padtypes`: struct that contain two objects: `graphset::padtypes::Graph` and `graphset::padtypes::Residuals` useful for passin arguments.

`void graphset::setgraphsize(graphset::padtypes g, bool logx = false, bool logy = false, bool drawresiduals = true)`: set automatic graph size, logarithmic axis if needed, and turn on and off residual graph.

`void graphset::setcanvas(_TObj *c1, int nx = 1, int ny = 1, float m_left, float m_right, float m_bottom, float m_top)`: auto set canvas size. All parameters are altready set, so basic usage is by passing only `_TObj` as argument.

`void graphset::fillresiduals(_TObj *g, _TFObj *g_fit, TGraphErrors *r)`: fill residuals for any `_TObj` using `_TFObj` fit function.

`void graphset::setmarker()`: set marker and full line color and get matching both.
